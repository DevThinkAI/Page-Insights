**Summary:**
- Google's AI unit, DeepMind, is reportedly using generative AI to develop at least 21 different tools for life advice, planning, and tutoring.
- Google has contracted with Scale AI, a startup focused on training and validating AI software, to test these tools.
- The testing process includes examining whether the tools can offer relationship advice or help users answer intimate questions.
- Despite the development of these tools, Google's AI safety experts have warned that users taking life advice from AI tools could experience diminished health and well-being, and a loss of agency.
- The tools being developed by DeepMind are not intended for therapeutic use, and Google's publicly available Bard chatbot only provides mental health support resources when asked for therapeutic advice.
- The use of AI in a medical or therapeutic context is controversial, with mixed opinions from physicians and regulators about its short-term benefits.
