**Description:** The webpage provides a comprehensive guide on managing forests for health and climate change mitigation in Connecticut.
**Summary:**
- Forests are a natural climate solution, mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration and storage.
- Sound forest management is critical to ensure forests remain carbon sinks and effective components of natural climate solutions.
- Management options for healthy forests include avoiding deforestation and land conversion, establishing reserves, promoting reforestation and afforestation, and actively managing forests.
- Active forest management diversifies conditions across the landscape and promotes forest health, resilience, and adaptability.
- Approaches to active forest management that promote forest health, resilience, and carbon include extended rotations, thinnings to improve the growth of remaining trees, structural complexity enhancement, increasing the proportion of younger age classes, retaining big trees, retaining and increasing deadwood, increasing stocking, increasing species diversity, planning harvests to retain quality trees and limit residual damage, and increasing the proportion of durable wood products.
- Each approach has its own benefits and potential drawbacks, and the choice of approach depends on the specific goals and conditions of the forest.

**Description:** The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service outlines the four key features of a healthy forest and provides tips on how to contribute to forest conservation.
**Summary:**
- A healthy forest is characterized by biodiversity, with a wide variety of species from all kingdoms of life, including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms.
- Different forest features provide a variety of habitats for different animals and plants, which can change depending on elevation, climate, and access to water.
- A healthy forest should have trees of different sizes and ages, indicating a balance between new growth and mature trees. The absence of young trees could signal poor soil conditions, while dying mature trees could indicate extended drought or disease.
- Clean water is essential for all species in a forest. Robust root systems from trees, shrubs, and grasses help control erosion and maintain clean water sources.
- The article also provides tips on how to help maintain healthy forests, including following the Seven Principles of Leave No Trace and learning more about the impact of climate change on forests.
